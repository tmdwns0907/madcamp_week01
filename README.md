&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This repository is for madcamp project of first week. 
In this project, we make an android application with three tabs.
Each tab has its own content respectively: Address book, Photo gallery, and KAIST convenience facilities.  

  
#### Tab1: Address book
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tab is for address book. We implemented it as getting all phone numbers and names which are saved  on JSON file, 
and show them. Implementing, we used ListView, and adapter to show the contents.   
    
#### Tab2: Gallery
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tab is for Gallery. We implemented it as getting all photos in local drawable folder and show
them as gridview.   
  
#### Tab3: KAIST convenience facilities
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tab is for KAIST convenience facilities. We implemented as getting all list of facilities like(cafe, cafeteria, toilet, etc).
All users can track their own location. and they can find location of facilities to use.
